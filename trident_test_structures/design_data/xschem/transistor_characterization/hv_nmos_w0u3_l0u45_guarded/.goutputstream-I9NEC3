# HV NMOS minimum size W0u3_L0u3

As leakage currents will be of paramount importance in the trident chip, it is worth reproducing
the leakage measurements in a setup made specifically for it.

The plan is to use fully guarded test structure with no ESD protection, and measure
it under the same setup that was use to characterize previous chips (UTOPIA, ACCURATE) made by the HSE-RP-IL section.
It uses ultra-low current cable such as the internal pair of the SPA6 cable, the keithley 6430 and
an unpackaged chip bonded on a guarded PCB.


## IHP Characterization

IHP has already made characterization for the minimum size HV NMOS.
The values of interest in this instance are the gate leakage and the drain to source leakage for Vd=0.1 and T=27Â°C

## SPICE Models

Provided spice models do not seem to take into account either the gate leakage.
The drain to source leakage in deep subthreshold regime shows large difference
to the measurements.
